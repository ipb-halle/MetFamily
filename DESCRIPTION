Description: Untargeted discovery 
  of metabolite families offering a bird's eye view of metabolic regulation 
  in comparative metabolomics. We implemented the presented methodology 
  in the easy-to-use web application MetFamily to enable the analysis 
  of comprehensive metabolomics studies for all researchers worldwide.
