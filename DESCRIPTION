Description: Untargeted discovery of metabolite families offering a bird's
    eye view of metabolic regulation in comparative metabolomics. We
    implemented the presented methodology in the easy-to-use web
    application MetFamily to enable the analysis of comprehensive
    metabolomics studies for all researchers worldwide.
